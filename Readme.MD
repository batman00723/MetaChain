## Project Title
**MetaChain: Decentralized Infrastructure for Metaverse Asset Ownership**

---

## Project Description
MetaChain is a blockchain-based platform designed to securely register, verify, and transfer ownership of digital assets within the metaverse.  
It provides transparency, trust, and verifiable digital ownership through smart contracts.

Built using **Solidity**, MetaChain ensures that virtual items, NFTs, and other metaverse assets have verifiable proof of existence and ownership.

---

## Project Vision
To build a **decentralized foundation for the metaverse economy** — where users truly own their digital creations and can transfer them seamlessly across virtual worlds.

MetaChain envisions a future where blockchain ensures digital sovereignty, asset interoperability, and immutable provenance.
